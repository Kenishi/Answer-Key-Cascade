"""Name: Answer Key CascadeFilename: Answer_Key_Cascade.pyVersion: 0.5Author: KenishiDesc:	By defualt Anki 2 now reduces the button count depending on card age.		Cards can now have anywhere from 2 to 4 buttons max depending on age.		Answering a card with 2 buttons requires you to press 1 or 2 if you are using hotkeys.		This can interfere with review speed if you don't realize its 2 buttons and answer 3/4.		This addon makes it so answering with a higher ease than possible will answer with the actual highest.				*Example* 3 Button card: You press "4", the addon answers with "3".
		Thanks go to ospalh(https://github.com/ospalh) for simpler implementation (should also eliminate state bugs)				Report bugs to https://github.com/Kenishi/Answer-Key-Cascade				"""
